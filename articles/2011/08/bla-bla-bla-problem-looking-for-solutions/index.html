<h1>Bla-Bla-Bla Problem - Looking for Solutions</h1>

<p>Communications and concentration are both equally important in software development.
You need to be aware what happens inside your team and, at the same time, you got own job to be done.
There might be a conflict.</p>

<p>Communication vs concentration dilemma exists only under quite narrow conditions.
The first condition is <strong>emotions</strong>, such conversation distracts much more than a calm.
Next factor is the <strong>distance</strong>, what I call 'overhead speaking' is the killer,
a group discussion in 12m aside at open office space is a little nuisance.
The last one is the <strong>duration</strong>, probably it's personal,
but I can barely survive listening a colleague speaking on the phone for the second hour.
At the same time, a couple of minutes small talk can be nice and refreshing.</p>

<p>The issue is complex enough to have several possible solutions.</p>

<p>The most obvious organizational way is
convincing your boss to separate 'speaking' and 'coding' people.
It can succeed but often it isn't a case.</p>

<p>A longer way is promoting proper communication culture.
Chats, emails, wikis for discussions.
The sound of keyboards is not distracting, at least for programmers.
The lovely by-product of this could be better documentation.
Nice, but again, it's a lot of time.</p>

<p>The example of a personal way would be the ability to 'cut off' everything from outside,
don't pay any attention to your environment at all.
Code, documentation, code, code, twitter, code, browser, debugger...
It's not easy but fairly possible to develop such mental skill over the time.
Only one problem, I don't want to ignore my teammates.
It fills unethical and counterproductive.
Summarizing, the way is quite hard and has essential side effects, looks like the last resort.</p>

<p>A geekish way.
Remember, I heard about a device that starts play music
when people in the room speak too loud and emotionally.
Developed for couples who swear a lot.
Probably, it's a partial solution of the problem.</p>

<p>A programmer's way.
I love recursion, so it is writing <em>this article</em> and sending the link to my colleagues.</p>

<p>Obviously, the best way is the combination of several different approaches.
The list above looks fine to start but it's surely incomplete.
Would be quite interesting to extend it.
And you are welcome to help me with that.</p>
