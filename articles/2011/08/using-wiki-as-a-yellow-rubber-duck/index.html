<h1>Using Wiki as a Yellow Rubber Duck</h1>

<p>During troubleshooting it can be quite useful try to explain the problem.
The listener's personality is not particularly important in this case.
It can be a colleague or a yellow rubber duck.
The explanation helps you to look at the problem from a bit different angle
and often find a decent solution.</p>

<p>If I can explain the problem, why I can't simply write it down?
Sometimes the formulation itself does not work,
I can go further and log all troubleshooting attempts.
The logging often brings new ideas
and definitively helps to avoid repeating the same steps again and again.
If something is written down, it is considered as a reliable fact,
the base for the next step. When the issue is eventually resolved,
it may be useful to spend a couple of minutes
and think how to avoid similar troubles in the future.
And again write it down.</p>

<p>A whiteboard, sheet of paper or text file can be used for this technique.
I personally love wikis. It provides me one small but important benefit, the URL.
It can be shared with other team members
or sent to my boss as the precise answer to what I am doing now question :)</p>
